## SM2：

Project: report on the application of this deduce technique in Ethereum with ECDSA

文件见Report on Ethereum with ECDSA文件，参考链接1：zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/442141489
参考链接2：https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_39430411/article/details/118685484


Project: impl sm2 with RFC6979

Project: verify the above pitfalls with proof-of-concept code

Project: Implement the above ECMH scheme

Project: Implement a PGP scheme with SM2

Project: implement sm2 2P sign with real network communication

Project: PoC impl of the scheme, or do implement analysis by Google

Project: implement sm2 2P decrypt with real network communication

## <!--Bitcoin：-->

<!--Project: forge a signature to pretend that you are Satoshi-->

## Bitcoin-public：

Project: send a tx on Bitcoin testnet, and parse the tx data down to every bit, better write script yourself

Project: forge a signature to pretend that you are Satoshi

## Ethernet-public：

Project: research report on MPT

## Real-world-cryptanalysis：

Project: Find a key with hash value “\*sdu_cst_20220610\*” under a message composed of \*your name\* followed by \*your student ID\*. For example, “\*San Zhan 202000460001\*”.

Project: Find a 64-byte message under some k fulfilling that their hash value is symmetrical

## Real-world-ZK：

Project: Write a circuit to prove that your CET6 grade is larger than 425. 

a.Your grade info is like (cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe). These grades are published as commitments onchain by MoE. 

b.When you got an interview from an employer, you can prove to them that you have passed the exam without letting them know the exact grade. 

Project:  The commitment scheme used by MoE is SHA256-based. 

a. commit = SHA256(cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe, r)
